- `database/migrations/2025_10_13_184838_add_exchange_fields_to_cash_transactions_table.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_10_13_185652_create_location_user_table.php`

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Business Logic & Workflows (COMPLETED)

### Priority 1: Core Shift Workflow ✅

#### 2.1 Shift Opening Logic ✅
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `app/Actions/StartShiftAction.php`
  - ✅ quickStart() method for one-click shift starting
  - ✅ Auto-selects location based on user's assigned locations
  - ✅ Automatically carries over ending balances from previous shift
  - ✅ Zero manual input required for cashiers

**Implementation Steps:**
```php
// In StartShiftAction:
1. Get user's assigned locations: $user->locations()
2. Find last closed shift for selected drawer
3. Copy endSaldos as beginningSaldos for new shift
4. Set status = 'open', opened_at = now()
5. Create shift record
```

#### 2.2 Running Balance Calculation ✅
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `app/Models/CashierShift.php`
  - ✅ Added `getRunningBalanceForCurrency(Currency $currency)` method
  - ✅ Added `getAllRunningBalances()` for multi-currency support
  - ✅ Real-time calculation: beginning + cash_in - cash_out

**Implementation:**
```php
public function getRunningBalanceForCurrency(Currency $currency): float
{
    $beginning = $this->getBeginningSaldoForCurrency($currency);
    $cashIn = $this->getTotalCashInForCurrency($currency);
    $cashOut = $this->getTotalCashOutForCurrency($currency);

    return $beginning + $cashIn - $cashOut;
}
```

#### 2.3 Shift Closing & Reconciliation ✅
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `app/Actions/CloseShiftAction.php`
  - ✅ Calculates expected vs counted for each currency
  - ✅ Auto-flags as UNDER_REVIEW if discrepancy detected
  - ✅ Sets CLOSED status if no discrepancies
  - ✅ Requires discrepancy_reason if mismatch
  - ✅ Updates drawer balances JSON with counted amounts
  - ✅ Sets closed_at timestamp

**Logic:**
```php
foreach ($currencies as $currency) {
    $expected = $shift->getNetBalanceForCurrency($currency);
    $counted = $countedAmounts[$currency];
    $discrepancy = $counted - $expected;

    if (abs($discrepancy) > 0.01) {
        $shift->status = ShiftStatus::UNDER_REVIEW;
        // Create EndSaldo record with discrepancy
    }
}

// Update drawer balances
$shift->cashDrawer->initializeBalancesFromShift($shift);
```

#### 2.4 Transaction Auto-Timestamping ✅
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `app/Models/CashTransaction.php`
  - ✅ Added `boot()` method
  - ✅ Auto-sets `occurred_at = now()` on creating
  - ✅ Auto-sets `created_by` from authenticated user

**Implementation:**
```php
protected static function boot()
{
    parent::boot();

    static::creating(function ($transaction) {
        if (!$transaction->occurred_at) {
            $transaction->occurred_at = now();
        }

        if (!$transaction->created_by) {
            $transaction->created_by = auth()->id();
        }
    });
}
```

---

### Priority 2: Role-Based Access Control ✅

#### 2.5 Permissions & Policies ✅
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `app/Policies/CashierShiftPolicy.php`
  - ✅ `update()`: Cashiers can only update their own OPEN shifts
  - ✅ Managers/admins can always update
  - ✅ Added `approve()` and `reject()` methods for managers

- [x] `app/Policies/CashTransactionPolicy.php`
  - ✅ `create()`: Only if shift is open
  - ✅ `update()/delete()`: Only if shift is open AND user created it
  - ✅ Managers can override all restrictions

**Implementation:**
```php
// CashierShiftPolicy
public function update(User $user, CashierShift $shift): bool
{
    // Managers and admins can always edit
    if ($user->hasAnyRole(['manager', 'admin', 'super_admin'])) {
        return true;
    }

    // Cashiers can only edit their own open shifts
    return $shift->user_id === $user->id && $shift->isOpen();
}
```

---

### Priority 3: Manager Approval Workflow ✅

#### 2.6 Approval Actions ✅
**Files Created:**
- [x] `app/Actions/ApproveShiftAction.php`
  - ✅ `approve()`: Manager approves shift → CLOSED status
  - ✅ `reject()`: Manager rejects shift → reopens for recount
  - ✅ `approveWithAdjustment()`: Approve with corrections
  - ✅ Tracks approver, approval time, and notes
- [x] Migration: `add_approval_fields_to_cashier_shifts_table.php`
  - ✅ approved_by, approved_at, approval_notes
  - ✅ rejected_by, rejected_at, rejection_reason

**UI Location:** CashierShiftResource table action (pending implementation)

## 📋 Technical Debt & Known Issues

1. **User model has stub role methods** (lines 149-163 in User.php)
   - Needs Spatie Permission properly configured
   - Current stubs return `true` for all roles (INSECURE!)
   - **Priority:** HIGH - Must fix before production

2. **CashierShiftResource UI not yet updated**
   - Business logic complete, UI integration pending
   - Need to integrate quickStart() method
   - Need approve/reject actions for managers

3. **CashTransactionResource needs enhancement**
   - Display exchange transaction details
   - Show location context from shift

4. **No validation for multi-currency transactions**
   - Should ensure related_amount exists if related_currency is set
   - Can add validation rule to CashTransaction model

---

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

### To Continue Implementation:

```bash
# 1. Check current branch
git status

# 2. Start with highest priority
# Implement StartShiftAction with auto-preselect logic

# 3. Run tests
php artisan test

# 4. Create LocationResource
php artisan make:filament-resource Location

# 5. Update CashierShiftResource forms
```
