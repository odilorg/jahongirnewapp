FULL CONVERSATION: HOTEL POS SYSTEM (Laravel + Filament v4)

---

[User & Assistant Conversation Summary]

User: Hey there! Not much, just here and ready to help out. Hope you're doing well. Let me know what we’re diving into today!
Assistant: Absolutely, I get what you mean. Basically, you're looking to build a point-of-sale module in your Laravel and Filament v4 setup that can handle tracking cash flow during each cashier shift...

(Conversation continues, covering:)

• Cashier shift tracking (open, close, reconcile)
• Multi-currency handling (UZS, USD, EUR, RUB)
• Complex transactions (exchange, expenses, payments, deposits)
• Real-time running balances
• Shift discrepancy review workflow
• Manager/admin oversight & role-based permissions (Filament Shield)
• Entity structure: Hotel → Location → Cash Drawer → Shift → Transaction
• UI logic for Filament v4 with automatic timestamps and live recalculations
• Example workflow (“John the cashier” scenario)
• Phased architecture (Structure, Logic, Filament UI)
• Business rules: automatic timestamps, lock closed shifts, carry-over balances
• Security and roles (cashier, manager, admin)
• Hotel/location assignment system with multi-select for managers
• Running balance calculation examples (manual math for multi-currency scenario)
• Discrepancy flagging and review mechanism
• Filament Shield integration for permissions
• High-level architecture, logic flow, and prompt creation for AI coder
• Decision to generate AI coder `.txt` file (AI_Coder_POS_System_Prompt.txt)
• Final step: export full conversation as `.txt`
